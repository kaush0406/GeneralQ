Hi Mike,

We would like to confirm the expected behaviour for the following scenario:

For a PPT with an SDB fund initiating a SEP SERVICE withdrawal and selecting Full Withdrawal:
	•	When the Full Balance option is selected, a pop-up message appears indicating that “this request requires additional paperwork.”
	•	If the user clicks Continue, the system displays a hard stop page instructing them to contact a representative.
	•	If the pop-up is closed or dismissed, the Full Withdrawal option becomes unchecked, and the request proceeds as a partial withdrawal. However, the withdrawal amount continues to display as the total vested amount available.

Could you please confirm:
	1.	Is this behaviour aligned with the intended design?
	2.	Should the process always enforce a hard stop, or should the PPT be permitted to submit the request through a prefilled form instead?
