Description
1) Update server information so we have documentation on each application that is installed on each server, what environment (production, development, QA Testing, UAT Testing, etc.) the server is used for, any unique identifiers for the servers such as IP address, Hostname, Full Qualified Domain name (FQDN), and asset tags so that each server can be easily identified as to what applications are running on it, and what environments the server is used in.
2) Create/update release / deployment documentation and procedures, outlining the approvals and artifacts required for each step and the timing of each as well as any rules around timing of deployments as related to the change management meetings and Remedy / Service now change tickets.
3) Update FDT6 application documentation to include:
How the application is deployed for end user/testing use (ie: citrix deployment, web app that is accessible via a browser, client application install on end user computer, etc.)
Whether the application is a batch application or interactive application that an end user uses/interacts with.
File inputs to the application (if any) and file outputs from the application (if any).
If a batch application, the times that the application is executed by autosys and typical duration the application runs.
 
 
As a part of my training I have learnt about various applications supported by our team i.e VS-Finance-T6. Example: CMA, FOTS, OnBase, IRDB etc.
I have learnt about our different AWS servers.
I am familiar with Autosys, MoveIT, PAM.
I am familiar with IRDB Month End Activities.
I am familiar with Prod and Non-Prod Server Patching.
I am familiar with Morning Daily Checklist.
 


Answer
I acquired several new skills and knowledge. I delved into money out processes and gained experience in sprint planning and retrospectives while working in an agile methodology.
I learned the development, deployment and testing of Spring Batch Applications. This also provided me with the opportunity to work with YAML files and write comprehensive Junit Tests.
 
Regarding my career, I made notable progress by attaining proficiency in Java programming and upgrading my skills in AWS deployment. Furthermore, I had the privilege of undertaking an independent project where I could assume a leadership role and take ownership, allowing me to further enhance my professional growth.
 
On connections front, I had the pleasure of meeting and collaborating with new colleagues within the company. The collaborative spirit and teamwork that emerged from these interactions were truly remarkable.
