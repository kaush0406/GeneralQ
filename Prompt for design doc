3. Implementation
- High-level architecture overview
- Components/classes involved
- Flow of execution (request → service → repository → external system)
- Any design pattern used (strategy, factory, decorator, etc.)

4. Changes to be Made (With Code Examples and Explanation)
For each major change:
- Mention file/class name
- Show the relevant code snippet from the diff
- Explain what changed
- Explain why it was implemented that way
